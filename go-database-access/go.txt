ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE

A .env file is commonly used to store environment variables in a key-value 
format. This file is used to configure applications without hardcoding 
sensitive or environment-specific information directly into the source code.

Usage in Code
In a Go application, you can use a package like github.com/joho/godotenv 
to load the environment variables defined in a .env file into your 
program's environment.

Benefits of Using a .env File
****Separation of Configuration from Code: Keeps configuration details 
out of the source code, making it easier to manage and secure.
****Ease of Use: Simple format and easy to read and write.
****Portability: Makes it easy to move the application between different 
environments (development, testing, production) by just changing the .env file.
****Security: Sensitive information like passwords and API keys are not 
hardcoded in the source code and can be managed separately.
