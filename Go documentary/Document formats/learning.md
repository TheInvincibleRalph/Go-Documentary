## On PPTX Files

### What is a PPTX File?

- **PPTX File:** A PPTX file is a PowerPoint presentation file.*Under the hood, it's not just a single file but actually a compressed (zipped) collection of several files and folders that work together to define the entire presentation.*

- **ZIP Archive:** The PPTX file is structured as a ZIP archive. This means that if you were to unzip a PPTX file, you would find a bunch of files and folders inside, each serving a specific purpose in the presentation.

### What’s Inside a PPTX File?

- **XML Files:** The core content of a PPTX file is stored in XML files. These XML files are what define everything in your presentation, including slides, text, images, formatting, and even animations.

  - **Slides as XML Files:** Each slide in a presentation is typically stored as a separate XML file within the PPTX archive. For example, the first slide might be stored in a file called `slide1.xml`, the second slide in `slide2.xml`, and so on. These files are usually located in a folder like `ppt/slides/`.

### The Code Example

In your code, you're simulating the creation of a PPTX file by creating a mock ZIP archive. Here’s what the specific line you asked about does:

```go
{
    {"ppt/slides/slide1.xml", "<p:sld><p:txBody><a:p><a:r><a:t>Slide 1 content</a:t></a:r></a:p></p:txBody></p:sld>"},
    {"ppt/slides/slide2.xml", "<p:sld><p:txBody><a:p><a:r><a:t>Slide 2 content</a:t></a:r></a:p></p:txBody></p:sld>"},
}
```

1. **List of Files:**
   - This part of the code is creating a list of files that you want to include in the ZIP archive (which is pretending to be a PPTX file).
   - Each entry in the list represents one file:
     - The first entry represents the first slide (`slide1.xml`).
     - The second entry represents the second slide (`slide2.xml`).

2. **File Paths (Names):**
   - `"ppt/slides/slide1.xml"` and `"ppt/slides/slide2.xml"` are the file paths inside the ZIP archive.
   - These paths follow the structure of a real PPTX file, where each slide is stored in the `ppt/slides/` folder.

3. **File Content (Body):**
   - `"<p:sld><p:txBody><a:p><a:r><a:t>Slide 1 content</a:t></a:r></a:p></p:txBody></p:sld>"` is the content of the first slide.
   - It’s written in XML, which is a language used to define structured data in a readable way.

### The XML Content

The XML tags are simplified versions of what you might find in an actual PPTX file:

- **`<p:sld>`:** This tag represents the slide itself.
- **`<p:txBody>`:** This tag represents the text body on the slide.
- **`<a:p>`:** This represents a paragraph within the text body.
- **`<a:r>`:** This represents a "run," or a segment of text within a paragraph.
- **`<a:t>`:** This tag holds the actual text content that would appear on the slide, like "Slide 1 content" or "Slide 2 content."

### Why Use XML?

- **PPTX Structure:** PowerPoint uses XML to define all the elements of a presentation because it’s a standardized and flexible way to store complex data (like slide layouts, text, images, etc.) in a way that both computers and humans can understand.

- **Testing with Mock Data:** In your code, you're using XML because you’re trying to create a mock version of a PPTX file. By using XML, your mock slides look like real slides, which lets you test how your code would handle actual PPTX files.

### Summary

- PPTX files are ZIP archives containing XML files that describe the presentation's content.
- In your code, you're creating mock XML files to represent slides inside a PPTX file.
- *The XML structure defines the text content of each slide, mimicking how PowerPoint internally stores slide data.*

**Code ref:**

```go
func createMockPPTXReader() io.Reader {
	buf := new(bytes.Buffer)
	w := zip.NewWriter(buf)

	var files = []struct {
		Name, Body string
	}{
		{"ppt/slides/slide1.xml", "<p:sld><p:txBody><a:p><a:r><a:t>Slide 1 content</a:t></a:r></a:p></p:txBody></p:sld>"},
		{"ppt/slides/slide2.xml", "<p:sld><p:txBody><a:p><a:r><a:t>Slide 2 content</a:t></a:r></a:p></p:txBody></p:sld>"},
	}
	for _, file := range files {
		f, err := w.Create(file.Name)
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
		_, err = f.Write([]byte(file.Body))
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
	}

	err := w.Close()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	return bytes.NewReader(buf.Bytes())
}
```

### What is a Zip archuve?

A ZIP archive is a file format that allows multiple files to be compressed and stored together in a single file, usually with a `.zip` extension. This format is widely used for packaging and distributing files because it reduces the file size (through compression) and simplifies the transfer of multiple files.

### Key Features of ZIP Archives:

1. **Compression:**
   - ZIP archives typically use compression algorithms (like DEFLATE) to reduce the size of the files they contain. This makes it faster to transfer and store large collections of files.

2. **Multiple Files and Folders:**
   - A ZIP archive can contain multiple files and directories, preserving the original folder structure. This makes it easy to bundle related files together, such as documents, images, or software packages.

3. **Random Access:**
   - Unlike some other archive formats, ZIP files allow random access to individual files. This means you can extract or read specific files from the archive without having to unpack the entire archive.

4. **Metadata:**
   - ZIP archives can store metadata such as file names, directory structure, and timestamps, allowing the contents to be restored accurately when the archive is unpacked.

5. **Encryption:**
   - ZIP files can be password-protected and encrypted, adding a layer of security for the files contained within.

### Common Uses of ZIP Archives:

1. **File Distribution:**
   - When sharing multiple files via email or the web, people often compress them into a ZIP file to reduce size and simplify the transfer.

2. **Backup and Archiving:**
   - ZIP files are commonly used for backing up data. By compressing files into a ZIP archive, you save space and can easily store or transfer the backup.

3. **Software Packaging:**
   - Software developers often distribute their applications as ZIP archives, packaging all necessary files (like executables, libraries, and documentation) into a single file for easy download.

4. **Data Storage:**
   - For long-term storage or archival, data can be compressed into ZIP files to save space and keep related files together.
